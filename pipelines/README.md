# pipelines/ — the two frozen H-Nav configurations, runnable on new answering models

Two pipelines, identical everywhere except geometry:

| folder | geometry before the cosine screen | operating point (frozen) | committed result, conflicted sh_64k |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hnav_raw/` | none (raw cosine) | `cos_pair 0.90, r_min 0.44` | 17/66 → **37/66** vs native |
| `hnav_abtt/` | ABTT whitening, D=128, fit on sh_6k+sh_32k | `cos_pair 0.30, r_min 0.954` | 17/66 → **37/66** (exact null vs raw) |

Both then run the same detector: cosine pair screen → regex `pair_filter`
(subject+relation identity) → bidirectional NLI → suppression, through
`hnav/stage1/detector_gap.py`. **No detection logic lives in this folder** —
each pipeline is a frozen configuration plus a driver
(`_shared/runner.py`); the science stays in `hnav/`, covered by its tests.

## What is frozen and what varies

**Frozen, verified before every run** (sha256 / fingerprint pinned in each
`pipeline.json`; the runner refuses on any mismatch):
- the embedding model — `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-4B`, fp32, L8192. The
  thresholds and the whitening are *coordinates in that encoder's space*; G1
  measured that they do not transfer. A new embedder means a new calibration
  campaign, not this runner.
- both operating-point artifacts and the ABTT whitening artifact.
- the per-subset prepasses (`hnav/_out/stage1_prepass_<subset>_benchmarkpage
  [_abtt].json`) — chunking, candidate pairs, NLI table. These are
  **LLM-independent**: built once per subset, reused for every future model.

**What varies: the answering LLM only**, passed per run:

```bash
# on the GPU box, with the model served OpenAI-compatible (e.g. vLLM :8003)
python pipelines/hnav_raw/run.py  --llm-model <served-name> --llm-base-url http://localhost:8003/v1
python pipelines/hnav_abtt/run.py --llm-model <served-name> --llm-base-url http://localhost:8003/v1

# always first: budget + guard pre-flight, sends nothing
python pipelines/hnav_raw/run.py --llm-model <name> --dry-run
```

Each run writes `results/<model-tag>/`: the raw `detector_gap_*.json` per
subset, a `run_manifest.json` (model, endpoint, git head, pinned hashes), the
sh_64k dry-run log, and `REPORT.md` with the stratified table. Results you
want to keep must be committed deliberately (repo convention).

## Subsets, and how to present them in the thesis

All three subsets run by default — sh_6k, sh_32k, sh_64k — reported
**separately, never pooled** (store sizes span 455 → 4,580 facts; a pooled
number would average incomparable populations). Per subset, report the
committed strata (`question_strata.json`): **conflicted** is the primary
endpoint — it is the population the mechanism exists for — and **unique** is
the do-no-harm check. Give native vs H-Nav counts, the paired net, and the
McNemar exact p; `REPORT.md` emits exactly this table.

Label the roles: sh_6k and sh_32k are the **calibration split** (the
operating point was selected on their fact geometry — detection quality only,
no LLM, no gold answers in the objective), sh_64k is **held-out**. For a *new
answering model* all three are honest accuracy measurements — the selection
objective never saw any LLM's behaviour — but the labels should still appear,
and sh_64k remains the headline. sh_262k is excluded by design:
`detector_gap` refuses it (never part of the registered campaign, no prepass,
no NLI table) and the thesis should state it was not measured rather than
extrapolate.

One shot per model per subset. The runner refuses to overwrite an existing
results folder; a void run is reported as void, not re-rolled.

## Cost per new model

5 arms × 100 questions × 3 subsets = **1,500 LLM calls per pipeline**
(3,000 for both). The duplicated `native` arms are not waste: raw-vs-ABTT ran
against the same substrate twice and agreeing native arms are the proof the
contrast carries only the geometry (the campaign's native arms agreed
500/500).

## If something refuses

The runner's refusal messages name the fix. The common ones:
- **prepass missing** — build once per subset:
  `python hnav/stage1/confirmatory_prepass.py --subset <s>` (add
  `--geometry-space abtt --whitening-artifact stage0_results/abtt/abtt_whitening_D128.json`
  for the ABTT pipeline). Needs the embedding cache and the NLI model; no LLM.
- **operating point sha mismatch** — someone re-froze thresholds. That is a
  method change; re-pin the hash in `pipeline.json` only in the same commit
  that justifies it.
- **embed model mismatch** — `HNAV_EMBED_MODEL` is set to something other
  than the frozen encoder. Unset it; this runner is not the tool for a new
  embedder.
