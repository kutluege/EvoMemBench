"""Rigorous conflict-structure analysis of MemoryAgentBench Conflict_Resolution (factconsolidation).

Groups facts by (relation, subject) using induced templates, then reports:
  - template coverage
  - conflict-group counts / sizes
  - how many QUESTIONS target a conflicted (relation, subject)
  - whether ground-truth answers follow a "latest wins" rule
