"""Read-path policies — Stage 1, Faz B.  [T11 rerank; T13 fact-level]

The only interventions H-Nav ships. Protocol trail: ``KAPI_KARARI.md`` §3/§6
(instruments GO, write_policy NO_GO forever, read_policy CONDITIONAL) →
user decision 2026-08-15 (``STAGE1_PLAN.md`` §0 R2: rerank **plus** stale
suppression and placement, "only the mechanism the probe proves") → this
module. ``test_no_raw_entropy_in_policy.py`` permits exactly this file under
``hnav/core/*policy*.py`` and AST-scans it for the forbidden raw-score entropy.

Three mechanisms, all driven by the same :class:`~hnav.core.read_gate.ReadGate`
decision and all born ``shadow=True``:

``RERANK`` (T11, :func:`rerank_order`, :class:`ReadRerankPolicy`)
    A token-neutral permutation of the retrieved page: each verified group's
    LATEST carrier is promoted immediately above that group's highest-ranked
    stale rival. **Kept as evidence, not as a recommendation** — the T11
    calibration measured it systematically harmful (162 cells, 0 net-positive,
    helped 228 / harmed 441 with a precision-1.00 detector;
    ``STAGE1_NULL_ANALIZI.md``). Deleting it would delete the finding.

``SUPPRESS`` (T13, :func:`suppress_ids`, ``ReadFactPolicy("suppress")``)
    Name the stale member(s) of every verified group so the caller can drop
    them from the assembled page. Reduces tokens.

``DEMOTE_LATE`` (T13, :func:`demote_ids`, ``ReadFactPolicy("demote_late")``)
    Name each verified group's LATEST carrier so the caller can move it to the
    END of the assembled page, deleting nothing. Token-neutral.

Why FACT granularity, and why that is a contract and not a detail
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The oracle probe (``hnav/stage1/stale_suppression_probe.py``, sh_6k, 473 real
calls) measured, on the conflicted stratum: native 4/74, suppressing the stale
fact 66/74, moving the latest fact to the very END 20/74, moving it to the
FRONT 1/74. The model anchors on the LATE-appearing value. The same corpus
shows the CHUNK-level version of the same idea to be harmful, because one chunk
carries 230-260 facts and reordering it scrambles hundreds of unrelated ones.
So both new mechanisms act on single facts inside the retrieved chunks.

The page contract. The benchmark hook returns a page of **chunk texts**, so a
fact-level edit has to be expressed as a rewrite of chunk text. This module
does NOT do that rewrite: it emits *ids* (``payload["drop_ids"]`` /
``payload["move_last_ids"]``) and the ADAPTER performs the splice, because
locating a fact inside a chunk means knowing the benchmark's serial numbering
and its chunker — knowledge that hard rule 2 keeps out of ``hnav/core/``. The
adapter side is ``mab_adapter.fact_spans`` / ``mab_adapter.page_edit``, which
splice original bytes and never renumber or reflow.

Unit mapping. The gate works on whatever candidates the adapter gave it (facts,
on the primary arena); the page being RERANKED may be a coarser unit (chunks),
so ``rerank_order`` takes an ``id_map``. The fact-level mechanisms need no map
— they name gate members directly, and the adapter resolves them against the
page. Groups without a LATEST (``latest_id=None``) are skipped by all three:
the gate refused to name a newest member, so there is nothing defensible to
suppress or move.

Determinism. Every output is a pure function of ``(decision, ...)``. Groups are
consumed in the gate's own order; within a group, members keep the gate's
order; duplicates are dropped keeping the first occurrence.

Ambiguity signals reach these policies only through the gate, which consumes
them via ``RetrievalSignalSet.for_policy()`` — the z-scored ``H_z`` family,
never the raw-score entropy (hard rule 6).
