"""MemoryAgentBench adapter — InEp-Know, the PRIMARY arena.  [T4]

Owns every benchmark-specific fact about this arena so that ``hnav/core/`` does
not have to know any of them:

* memorize messages are 4096-token *chunks* of numbered facts, so a chunk is
  exploded into per-fact candidates with ``FACT_RE``;
* the fact's serial number is the benchmark's own supersession key and becomes
  ``Candidate.version``;
* retrieval units are chunks, not facts, so read-side staleness is resolved by
  mapping retrieved chunks back to the facts they contain.

**Shadow mode returns the caller's own object, unchanged.** ``before_memorize``
returns the exact ``message`` it was handed (identity, not a copy);
``after_retrieval`` returns a ``Decision`` whose ``shadow`` flag the caller must
check before acting. Nothing here mutates a store, and nothing here makes an LLM
call (invariants I1/I2/I3).

**Live mode (Stage 1, T11) arms exactly one seam.** Under ``HNAV_MODE=live``
the read decision is returned with ``shadow=False`` and the retriever hook
routes it through :meth:`MABAdapter.apply_read_decision`, which reorders the
native top-k page and nothing else — same chunk set, same count, order only,
with a fail-open fallback to the native page on any irregularity. The write
path stays observation-only in every mode (``write_policy`` NO_GO forever,
``KAPI_KARARI.md``). Protocol trail for lifting ``require_not_live`` here:
``STAGE1_PLAN.md`` §2 Faz B step 2; Stage-0 measurement scripts still refuse
live via ``config.require_not_live``.

Leakage: this module reads fact text and serial numbers only. It never opens the
dataset JSON, so it cannot see the ``questions`` list or the answer list that
sit in the same file. ``hnav/tests/test_leakage_audit.py`` enforces that by AST
scan.
