"""Oracle probe: is the conflicted-stratum failure POSITIONAL or PARAMETRIC?  [T12]

A **measurement**, not a policy. Nothing here can ship: every arm needs the
expected answer to decide which fact to cut or move, and the module lives under
``hnav/stage1/`` precisely because that is where reading the answer list is
permitted. It exists to separate two explanations that the native run confounds.

The thing being explained
-------------------------
``hnav/labeling/question_strata.py`` (T12) splits the arena's questions by
whether the queried ``(relation, subject)`` key carries a conflict at all:

* unique-key questions: **26/26 correct in all eight committed ``sh_6k`` runs**;
* conflicted-key questions: **0–5 of 74**, and 572 of the 575 errors are the
  *stale value of the correct key*.

So the model reliably finds the right key and reliably picks the superseded
value from it, under a prompt that states "the newer fact has larger serial
number". Two explanations fit that equally well from the native run alone:

**H-position/presence** — the stale fact is present, and earlier; the model
anchors on the first (or the most numerous) mention it sees. Remove the stale
fact and the answer becomes correct; move the newest to the end and it improves.

**H-parametric** — the contexts are counterfactual rewrites of world facts, so
the stale value is usually the *world-true* one ("the official language of Japan
is Japanese" while gold is "Swedish"). The model is overriding the context with
its parameters. Removing the stale sentence changes nothing, because the model
was never reading it: it recognises the subject and answers from memory.

The two make opposite predictions about ``oracle_suppress``, so one probe
separates them. That is the whole design.

Arms (per question, all graded with the benchmark's own evaluator)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
``native``          the untouched context.
``native_repeat``   the same prompt, a second independent call. This is the
                    in-harness **A/A floor**: every other arm's effect must be
                    read against it, not against zero.
``oracle_suppress`` every fact of the queried key whose value is not the
                    expected answer is deleted. Serials are NOT renumbered —
                    the prompt's rule is stated in terms of serial order, and
                    renumbering would silently change the task.
``oracle_recency``  nothing is deleted; the highest-serial fact of the queried
                    key is moved to the END of the context. Tests placement
                    alone — the direction the only positive result in this
                    corpus used, and the direction ``read_policy.rerank_order``
                    structurally cannot take (it reorders retrieved chunks, not
                    facts within one).
``anti``            the mirror of ``oracle_recency``: the highest-serial fact
                    goes to the FRONT and the most recent stale fact goes last.
                    Whichever end a model privileges, these two arms disagree
                    about which value sits there — so if placement is the
                    mechanism at all, they must move the number in *opposite*
                    directions. Both doing nothing rules placement out; both
                    helping means the effect is "the surgery touched this key",
                    not "the newest fact ended up here".

Readouts, all stratified by unique vs conflicted
------------------------------------------------
The unique stratum is natively 26/26 with zero observed flips across eight runs,
so it is a near-noiseless control: *any* drop there is an artifact of the
surgery, not sampling. Per arm: accuracy overall and per stratum, the A/A floor
alongside, and the paired McNemar cells (b = native right / arm wrong,
c = native wrong / arm right) with an exact two-sided binomial p.

Split discipline
----------------
``sh_6k`` + ``sh_32k`` only. ``sh_64k`` and ``sh_262k`` are the confirmatory
arena and are refused outright (exit 2), as in ``m4_marginal_diff_test.py`` and
``calibrate_read_policy.py``. ``HNAV_MODE=live`` is refused via
``config.require_not_live()``: this is a measurement, and a measurement taken
under intervention is not a measurement.

Harness, and its one deliberate deviation
-----------------------------------------
System message, query template and the ``Memory i:`` user-prompt shape are
imported from ``hnav/stage1/calibrate_read_policy.py``, which transcribes them
verbatim from ``utils/templates.py`` and ``RAGSystem.answer_query``. Grading is
``labeling.counterfactual.substring_exact_match``, the transcription of the
benchmark's own ``substring_exact_match``. ``generation_max_length`` is 10
tokens, as in the dataset config.

The deviation: the campaign feeds the model ``top_k`` *chunks in similarity-rank
order*. On the calibration split every chunk is retrieved (sh_6k: 2 chunks,
sh_32k: 9, against ``retrieve_num=10``), so the model already sees the whole
context — but the block order is query-dependent, which makes "the end of the
context" undefined for a placement experiment. This probe therefore presents the
context as a single ``Memory 1:`` block in context order, identically for every
arm. The native arm's accuracy is reported next to the campaign's recorded
number so the size of that difference is visible rather than assumed.
