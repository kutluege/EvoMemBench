# Geometric filtering, anisotropy, and ABTT whitening

*What is actually applied to text entering the H-Nav pipeline, what the embedding
space's anisotropy was measured to be, and why the whitening machinery is built,
tested — and switched off.*

Companion to `presentation_evidence/DETECTOR_MECHANICS.md` §2, which covers the
filter's decision logic. This document covers the *space* the filter operates in.

---

## 1. What is applied to incoming data

### 1.1 The embedding pipeline

Text entering H-Nav is turned into a vector by `HFEmbedder`
(`hnav/core/embedding.py:252-338`). Four steps, chosen to mirror the benchmark's
own retriever exactly:

| step | detail | code |
|---|---|---|
| tokenise + truncate | `max_length = 8192` (config default `embed_max_length`) | `embedding.py:326`, `config.py:60` |
| forward pass | `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-4B`, `float32`, 2560-d | `config.py`, `m1_geometry_calibration.json` |
| **mean pooling** over the attention mask | `(last * mask).sum(1) / mask.sum(1)` | `embedding.py:335-336` |
| **L2 normalisation** | `F.normalize(pooled, p=2, dim=1)` | `embedding.py:337` |

The module docstring states the constraint this exists to satisfy:

> `HFEmbedder`'s pooling mirrors `Qwen3Embedding4BEmbeddings` at
> `MemoryAgentBench/methods/embedding_retriever.py:58` — mean pooling over the
> attention mask, then L2 normalization — **so H-Nav's geometry is the geometry
> the benchmark itself retrieves in.**

Two consequences worth stating explicitly:

- **Every vector is a unit vector.** This is what makes `M Mᵀ` a cosine matrix and
  what makes the residual identity `r = √(1 − c²)` exact (`DETECTOR_MECHANICS.md`
  §2.3).
- **No centring, no whitening, no dimensionality reduction is applied.** The
  vectors that reach the cosine screen are the raw normalised mean-pooled
  outputs. This is the fact that makes anisotropy load-bearing.

Vectors are cached under `sha256(model|dtype|L{max_length}||text)`
(`cache_key`, `embedding.py:87-102`). `max_length` is in the namespace because it
changes the vector — the T12 defect, where 512-token truncation silently produced
different geometry, was born from its absence.

### 1.2 Then, and only then, the geometric filter

`ReadGate.decide` receives already-embedded records and applies, in order: the
pairwise cosine screen (`≥ 0.90`), union-find grouping, and the leave-one-out QR
span residual (`< 0.44`). No transformation of the vectors happens inside the
gate. See `DETECTOR_MECHANICS.md` §2 for the mechanics.

---

## 2. Anisotropy — and why it decides the threshold

**Anisotropy** is the empirical fact that contextual embeddings do not spread
over the unit sphere. They occupy a narrow cone, dominated by a few directions
shared by *every* input. The practical symptom: **two completely unrelated texts
have high cosine similarity.** For an isotropic space, random unit vectors in
2560 dimensions would have cosine ≈ 0 (concentrating with spread ≈ 1/√d ≈ 0.02).

This matters here for one reason: **the entire pipeline is thresholded on raw
cosine.** If unrelated facts sit at 0.60 rather than 0.00, then a threshold of
0.5 admits everything and the "similarity" screen filters nothing.

### 2.1 Measured: the primary arena

`hnav/stage0/m1_geometry_calibration.py` embedded, per subset, all *true*
conflict pairs and an equal-sized **random control** sample of non-conflicting
pairs. Source: `stage0_results/final/m1_geometry_calibration.json`, tabulated in
`presentation_evidence/data/item06_geometry_percentiles.csv`. All four subsets,
`Qwen3-Embedding-4B`, float32:

| subset | **control (unrelated) pairs** mean cos | p10 | p90 | conflict pairs mean cos | separation AUC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sh_6k | **0.6048** | 0.5312 | 0.6894 | 0.9547 | 1.0000 |
| sh_32k | **0.6062** | 0.5269 | 0.6846 | 0.9557 | 1.0000 |
| sh_64k | **0.6037** | 0.5187 | 0.6848 | 0.9557 | 1.0000 |
| sh_262k | **0.6125** | 0.5316 | 0.6934 | 0.9570 | 0.9999 |

**The anisotropy value is ≈ 0.604–0.613.** Two facts with nothing in common —
different subject, different relation, different object — sit at cosine 0.60, not
0.00. The nominal cosine range `[−1, 1]` is compressed to a working range of
roughly `[0.52, 1.00]`; the bottom 76% of the scale is never used.

### 2.2 Measured independently: the candidate-pair floor

A second, sharper view comes from the M1b grouping ablation
(`stage0_results/final/m1b_grouping_ablation.json`), which sweeps τ over every
kNN candidate pair. The τ at which the *first* pair falls below threshold is a
direct read of the distribution's floor:

| subset | candidate pairs | **all pairs still pass at τ =** | pairs surviving τ=0.90 |
|---|---|---|---|
| sh_6k | 3,144 | **0.58** | 190 (6.0%) |
| sh_32k | 16,770 | **0.61** | 1,363 (8.1%) |
| sh_64k | 33,755 | **0.63** | 3,201 (9.5%) |
| sh_262k | 135,875 | **0.65** | 24,372 (17.9%) |

Every one of 135,875 candidate pairs at sh_262k has cosine **≥ 0.65**. A
threshold below that value is not a filter — it is the identity function.

Note the floor **rises with store size** (0.58 → 0.65). This is the drift the
`TauPolicy` docstring warns about (`geometry.py:110-120`): in a larger store the
nearest neighbour of anything is closer, so *a constant threshold silently
tightens as the run proceeds*.

### 2.3 Measured on a second, non-synthetic corpus

The Cross-Episode control (`stage0_results/crossep/m5b_crossep_control.json`,
20,000 sampled pairs each, real dialogue chunks — not templated facts):

| population | mean cos | min | p05 | p95 | frac ≥ 0.95 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **across contexts** (unrelated conversations) | **0.7860** | 0.5260 | 0.6909 | 0.8653 | **0.0004** |
| within context | 0.9162 | 0.5978 | 0.8326 | 0.9713 | 0.2180 |

Unrelated chunks from *different conversations* average **0.786**. This corpus is
even more anisotropic than the synthetic fact corpus, which rules out the
template family as the cause — the anisotropy is a property of the encoder, not
of the data.

### 2.4 What this justifies

- **`cos_pair = 0.90` is not conservatism; it is the floor of the usable band.**
  At 0.85 precision is 0.436 (sh_6k) and 0.104 (sh_262k); at 0.90 it is 0.805 and
  0.282 (`m1b_grouping_ablation.json` PR curves).
- **Anisotropy does not destroy the signal here.** Conflict pairs sit at 0.955
  against a control mean of 0.604 — a 0.35 gap with *no overlap* between control
  p90 (0.689) and conflict p10 (0.913). Separation AUC is **1.0000** on three
  subsets and 0.9999 on sh_262k. The cone is narrow, but the two populations
  occupy different parts of it.
- **This is exactly why the repository forbids reusing the prior BFCL port's
  thresholds** (`CLAUDE.md`): a different encoder has a different cone, so a
  numeric threshold does not transfer.

## 3. ABTT whitening

### 3.1 What it does

**All-But-The-Top** (Mu & Viswanath) is the standard remedy for anisotropy:
remove the common mean and the few dominant directions that carry no
discriminative information but dominate cosine.
`ABTTWhitening` (`hnav/core/geometry.py:55-105`):

```
1.  μ = mean over the store's vectors
2.  centre:      X' = X − μ
3.  SVD:         X' = U Σ Vᵀ,  take the top D right singular vectors  C = V[:D]
4.  project out: v ↦ (v − μ) − ((v − μ) Cᵀ) C
5.  renormalise: v ↦ v / ‖v‖
```

Step 4 is `I − CᵀC` applied to the centred vector — an orthogonal projection onto
the complement of the dominant subspace. Defaults: `whiten_components = 3`,
`whiten_min_fit_n = 200` (`config.py:107-108`).

### 3.2 The refusal rule

`fit()` returns `refused = True` and falls back to raw cosine when the store has
fewer than `min_fit_n = 200` rows (`geometry.py:79-82`). The docstring:

> **Whitening must refuse to fit on a small store.** ABTT estimates a mean and a
> few principal directions; on the 6k subsets (455 facts) and on early
> CrossEp-Know contexts (<20 chunks) those estimates are noise.

`transform()` is a pass-through when unfitted, and `GeometrySignals` carries both
`whitened` and `whitening_refused` **so the fallback rate is reportable rather
than invisible** — a design rule worth transferring.

There is an architectural consequence: the read gate's candidate pool is capped
at **50 facts** (`select_pool`, `mab_adapter.py:321-344`). 50 < 200, so **ABTT
would refuse at gate time even if it were wired in.** Whitening is fittable at
corpus level (455 / 2,310 facts) but not at decision level.

### 3.3 Measured: does whitening actually help?

The A/B was run and committed — `stage1_calibration.json → provenance.abtt_ab`,
fitted on the **full fact matrix** per subset (`calibrate_read_policy.py:292-295`,
`whitening_fitted: true` in both):

| subset | pairs | true supersession | AUC cos **raw** | AUC cos **whitened** | AUC r_min **raw** | AUC r_min **whitened** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sh_6k | 4,501 | 1,437 | 0.9361 | **0.9546** (+0.019) | **0.3523** | **0.4513** (+0.099) |
| sh_32k | 24,232 | 1,282 | 0.9876 | **0.9908** (+0.003) | 0.6288 | **0.6946** (+0.066) |

Three readings, and the second is the important one:

**(a) Whitening helps cosine, marginally.** +0.019 AUC at sh_6k, +0.003 at
sh_32k. Real but small, and shrinking as the store grows — consistent with §2.1,
where the anisotropy offset is nearly constant across subsets and therefore
largely cancels in a *pairwise ranking* comparison. Anisotropy shifts all cosines
up together; AUC is invariant to a monotone shift.

**(b) The `r_min` signal is anti-predictive at sh_6k — AUC 0.3523, well below
0.5** — and whitening lifts it only to 0.4513, *still below chance*. Within the
loose-screen population, true supersession pairs tend to have **higher**
leave-one-out residuals than non-supersession pairs. This is independent
corroboration of `DETECTOR_MECHANICS.md` §2.3: the residual screen was frozen at
a pass-through value (`r_min = 0.44 ≈ √(1−0.90²)`) not by oversight but because
tightening it would have removed true positives. The selection rule's outcome and
this AUC agree.

**(c) None of it feeds a decision.** The artifact's own `note`:

> `"logged only - no decision consumes whitened values (V1 A/B evidence)."`

The separation is structural, not merely a disabled flag: **`GeometryModule` — the
only class that can hold an `ABTTWhitening` — is never constructed in
`hnav/adapters/mab_adapter.py` at all.** The primary arena's read path passes
record vectors straight to `ReadGate.decide`. Grep confirms every construction
site is elsewhere: `stage0/m3_headroom.py:150` (Stage-0 write-side measurement),
`stage0/crossep_m5_write_headroom.py:265` (secondary arena, commented *"whitening:
refused below 200 anyway"*), and `adapters/clbench_adapter.py:129` (secondary
arena). The shipped operating point (`stage1_operating_point.json`) contains no
whitening parameter. **Every number in the thesis was produced on raw, unwhitened
cosine.**

> **Comparability caveat.** The §3.3 AUCs and the §2.1 AUC of 1.0000 are *not* the
> same measurement. §2.1 separates conflict pairs from **random** pairs; §3.3
> separates true supersession from other pairs **that already passed the loose
> cosine screen** — a far harder, pre-filtered population. Do not present 1.0000
> and 0.9361 as a contradiction or as a degradation.

### 3.4 Why not turn it on

Stated plainly, because the honest answer is not "it doesn't work":

1. **It cannot run where the decision is made** (§3.2): the 50-fact pool is below
   `min_fit_n`.
2. **The gain is small and the pipeline does not need it.** Raw cosine already
   separates conflict from control at AUC 1.0000 (§2.1), and downstream precision
   at the frozen operating point is 1.000. There is no precision headroom for
   whitening to recover.
3. **Turning it on would change every threshold.** Whitening moves the cosine
   distribution, so `cos_pair` and `r_min` would need re-fitting — on the
   calibration split only, and the held-out shot is already spent.
4. **It is kept, tested and logged** (`test_geometry.py:49-81`: refusal below
   `min_fit_n`, removal of the dominant direction, determinism) so the decision is
   reversible and the evidence for reversing it is on disk.
