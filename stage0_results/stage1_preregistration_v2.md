## 0. The blocker, measured before anything was planned around it

`build_prompt(whole sh_64k context, question)` tokenized by the frozen :8003
server's own tokenizer (`/tokenize`, `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507`):

| subset | facts | chunks @4096 | retrieval complete at `top_k`=10? | whole-context prompt | top-10 page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sh_6k | 455 | 2 | **yes** | 6.7k tok | 6.5k tok |
| sh_32k | 2,310 | 9 | **yes** | 34.3k tok | 34.1k tok |
| **sh_64k** | 4,580 | **17** | **no — 10 of 17** | **75,886 tok** | ~42.4k tok |
| sh_262k | 18,332 | 67 | no — 10 of 67 | ~280k tok | ~42.5k tok |

Two independent facts follow, either one sufficient:

1. **Infeasible.** 75,886 > 65,536 by 10,350 tokens (15.8% over). `SUPPRESS`
   shortens the prompt by ~3.5%, which leaves ~73.2k — still over. **No arm
   fits**, so this is not a near-miss that a slightly smaller edit rescues.
2. **Not the deployed setting.** `sh_64k` is 17 chunks and the benchmark
   retrieves 10, so the system under study never sees ~41% of that context. The
   whole-context harness was a *deliberate, documented* deviation that was
   justified on the calibration split precisely because retrieval there is
   complete (2 and 9 chunks ≤ 10). That justification expires at `sh_64k`.

### Branch A — retrieval-path harness at `sh_64k` (recommended)

The page is the benchmark's own top-10 chunks in similarity-rank order, edited
through the shipped seam `MABAdapter.apply_read_decision`. ~42.4k tokens, fits
the frozen substrate untouched, and is the setting the deployed system actually
occupies. This merges the supervisor's items 2 and 3 **out of necessity, not
preference**, and it makes the calibration-split retrieval-path arm (§10) a
prerequisite rather than an extra: without it there is no bridge from the
whole-context calibration evidence to a retrieval-path confirmatory number.

Cost: the calibration bridge (2 × 500 calls) plus `sh_64k` (500 calls).

### Branch B — whole-context at `sh_64k` on a re-served substrate

Requires restarting the chat server with a larger `--max-model-len` and more KV
cache. This **breaks the frozen-substrate identity** against every calibration
number, including the two cross-run native checks that agreed 100/100 per
question and which are the sole reason the detector/oracle ratios are readable.
It also still measures a setting the benchmark never occupies (fact 2 above).

**Recommendation: Branch A.** Branch B buys a harness match at the cost of the
substrate match, and the substrate match is what the audit relied on.

Until this is decided, **no `sh_64k` inference is run.** The calibration-split
work in §10 proceeds, because it is authorized, non-confirmatory, and required
under Branch A anyway.

---

## 1. The claim, correctly scoped  *(requirement a)*

> On the MemoryAgentBench `Conflict_Resolution` single-hop arena, deleting the
> stale member of every **verified** conflict group from the assembled page —
> at FACT granularity, decided without any access to answers — raises accuracy
> on the conflicted stratum, at no cost on the non-conflicted stratum and at no
> token cost.

Everything that qualifies it, stated rather than implied:

- **Harness.** Per §0. The claim is scoped to the harness actually run and to no
  other. It is *not* a claim about the benchmark's default end-to-end pipeline
  unless Branch A is chosen, in which case it is.
- **Firing is unconditional.** At the frozen operating point the gate's
  ambiguity precondition is off, so the policy inspects **every** question
  (coverage 1.000 on both calibration subsets). There is no "only when the
  ranking looks ambiguous" story.
- **What the detector actually is.** Fact-level embedding geometry (pair cosine
  ≥ 0.90, leave-one-out span residual < 0.44) **+ a parsed-key subject-identity
  screen** (`MABAdapter.same_key_pair`) **+ bidirectional NLI contradiction ≥
  0.90**. That is the whole detector.
- **`nmargin` and `H_z` are INERT in this configuration.** They are carried in
  the frozen thresholds for the record and are consulted by nothing, because
  `ambiguity_mode="none"`. The reason is that they are the only gate inputs
  computed from CHUNK embeddings, which are still truncated at 512 of ~4,096
  tokens (the T12 defect, un-refit). **Consequence, stated plainly: the shipped
  mechanism is NOT "the frozen Stage-0 gate". The Stage-0 precondition layer is
  unvalidated here — it was switched off, not switched on and passed.** Any
  write-up that describes this as the Stage-0 gate operating end to end is
  wrong. Re-fitting the chunk embeddings and re-testing that layer is future
  work, not evidence.

---

## 2. Subsets  *(requirement b)*

**`sh_64k` ONLY.** Single confirmatory subset, single shot.

**`sh_262k` is excluded from the confirmatory claim.** Two measured reasons:
its gold-not-latest exposure is 3/76 = 3.9% (the highest of the four), and m3
measured net *harm* from intervention at that scale. If it is examined at all it
must be declared **exploratory**, run and reported separately, and must not
enter the confirmatory statistic under any circumstance.

`sh_6k` and `sh_32k` remain the calibration split and are never re-tuned.

---

## 3. Arms

Identical in structure to the T12/T13 design, so the confirmatory run is
readable against both.

| arm | what it does | role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `native` | untouched page | baseline |
| `native_repeat` | same prompt, independent second call | **A/A floor**, uncached by construction |
| `detector_suppress` | `ReadFactPolicy("suppress")` → drop every stale member of every verified group | **the confirmatory arm** |
| `detector_demote_late` | `ReadFactPolicy("demote_late")` → each group's LATEST carrier to the page end | reported, **not** part of the claim |
| `detector_anti` | measurement-only mirror: the same carriers to the FRONT | direction control, reported (see §8) |

Grading: `hnav.labeling.counterfactual.substring_exact_match`, the transcription
of the benchmark's own evaluator. `generation_max_length` 10, temperature 0.

**Operating point: frozen, and not touched on `sh_64k`.**
`stage0_results/stage1_operating_point.json` (commit `4f66c52`, 2026-08-15
15:30 UTC) — `cos_pair 0.90 · r_min 0.44 · ambiguity_mode none ·
nli_contradiction 0.90 · pair_filter True`. Fit on `sh_6k`+`sh_32k` from
detection quality only, with no LLM, no accuracy and no gold answer in the
objective. **Nothing is tuned on `sh_64k`.**

---

## 4. Primary success criterion, in McNemar terms  *(requirement e)*

All three must hold. Discordant pairs only; `b` = native right / arm wrong,
`c` = native wrong / arm right; `p` is the exact two-sided binomial on `b+c`.

1. **Conflicted stratum:** `net = c − b ≥ +10` **and** exact `p < 0.01`.
2. **Protected stratum:** the §5 criterion.
3. **Token cost:** `delta_chars_vs_native ≤ 0` for `detector_suppress`.

Bare Δaccuracy is reported but is not the criterion. The threshold is set in
advance at +10 because with `b` small that is already `p ≈ 0.002`, and because
the calibration effects (+62 of 74, +44 of 65) must be allowed to shrink
substantially — see §7 — without the design silently redefining success.

**Failure is a result.** If the criterion is not met, the outcome is reported as
a negative confirmatory result and the mechanism does not enter the thesis as an
improvement claim.

---

## 5. Protected stratum, with its noise floor  *(requirement d)*

The non-conflicted stratum is natively 26/26 and 35/35 on the calibration
subsets, so it is a near-noiseless control and any loss there is signal — with
one measured exception that must not be allowed to decide a one-shot campaign.

**The measured exception.** On `sh_6k`, `detector_suppress` lost exactly one
unique-stratum question: native emitted `"Shinzō Abe"`, the suppressed arm
emitted `"Sinzō Abe"`. A dropped letter. The gold fact was **still on the page**;
nothing about it was deleted. The substring-exact evaluator scores it wrong. That
is a malformed generation, not information loss.

**Criterion, chosen and justified.** Both parts are required.

- **(5a)** unique-stratum `net ≥ −1`.
- **(5b)** every unique-stratum loss is classified by a rule fixed here, in
  advance:
  - `malformed_generation` — the gold value is **present in the page the arm
    was shown** AND `difflib.SequenceMatcher(native_output, arm_output).ratio()
    ≥ 0.8`;
  - `information_loss` — otherwise.
  - **A single `information_loss` on the unique stratum voids the protective
    claim, whatever the net is.**

*Why this rather than N>1.* A replicate at `sh_64k` costs another ~500 calls at
~42k prompt tokens each (~21M tokens, hours on a shared GPU) and would buy
little: the A/A floor has now been measured at **exactly 0/0 discordant on 200
paired questions across two subsets**, i.e. this substrate does not flip answers
between identical calls, so a within-run replicate mostly re-measures zero. What
N>1 would genuinely protect against is one malformed generation deciding the
outcome — and (5b) addresses that failure mode *directly and falsifiably*
instead of averaging over it. If (5a) fails while every loss is classified
`malformed_generation`, that is reported as an inconclusive protective result
and a replicate is then justified; it is not silently rounded to a pass.

---

## 6. Harm ceilings and the gold-cut prediction  *(requirement c)*

The detector applies the benchmark's own stated rule — the highest serial is
newest — so on questions where the gold value is **not** carried by the highest
serial, it deletes the gold. This is countable from the parse in advance.

| subset | conflicted | gold NOT latest | exposure | conflicted-question recall | **predicted gold-cuts** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sh_6k | 74 | 0 | 0.0% | 0.973 | 0 — **observed 0** |
| sh_32k | 65 | 2 | 3.1% | 0.938 | 1.88 → 2 — **observed 2** (1 became an accuracy flip) |
| **sh_64k** | 66 | **2** | **3.0%** | 0.957 (pooled) | **1.91 → 2** |

**Registered prediction: `n_conflicted_gold_cut` on `sh_64k` = 2, and the only
arithmetically possible outcomes are 0, 1 or 2.** Of those, at most 2 can appear
as accuracy flips, and fewer if the affected questions were already wrong
natively (which is what happened on `sh_32k`: 2 cuts, 1 flip).

This is the most falsifiable element of the design and is committed to in
advance. The campaign artifact reports observed against predicted, and a
mismatch is reported as a mismatch — it is not re-explained afterwards.

**Additional pre-registered harm ceilings:**

- `n_suppressed_harmful` (a deleted fact that carries its key's *current* value,
  judged per key over the whole drop set) must be **0**. It was 0 on all 2,673
  calibration deletions. Any non-zero value is a void condition (§7).
- Pooled harm on the conflicted stratum: `b ≤ 4` (i.e. ≤ 2 above the 2 predicted
  gold-cuts). Exceeding it does not void the run but must be reported as the
  criterion having been met with unexplained harm, and blocks the improvement
  claim pending forensics.

---

## 7. Void conditions  *(requirement f)*

If any of these holds, the run is **void**: it is reported as void, no
confirmatory claim is made from it, and it does not count as the single shot
having been spent on a negative result. **Which of them void the whole run and
which void only the protective claim is settled in advance in Amendment 4 (R2)
— condition 5 voids the protective claim only; every other condition voids the
run.**

1. `n_page_edit_mismatch > 0` — the probe-style arm and the shipped `page_edit`
   path disagree on any question. The measurement would not be measuring the
   mechanism that ships.
2. **Native arm out of band.** `native` overall accuracy outside **[0.30, 0.50]**.
   Derivation, fixed in advance: m3-harness `accuracy_native` for `sh_64k` is
   0.440, and the measured m3→campaign-harness offset on the calibration split
   was −0.04 (`sh_6k` 0.33→0.29) and −0.05 (`sh_32k` 0.47→0.42), predicting
   ≈0.39–0.40; the band is that ±0.10. This is a substrate/harness sanity check,
   not a hypothesis test. Additionally the unique stratum must be ≥ 0.80 native
   — the entire protective design presumes that stratum is near-noiseless.
3. **A/A floor non-zero.** `b + c > 0` between `native` and `native_repeat`.
   Measured 0/0 on 100 questions on each calibration subset; a non-zero floor
   means the substrate changed under us and every paired statistic is unreadable.
4. `n_suppressed_harmful > 0` in the frozen-detection audit on `sh_64k`.
5. Any unique-stratum harm classified other than `malformed_generation`.
   **RESTATED BY AMENDMENT 4 (R1)** — the original wording named a class that
   Amendment 2 superseded, which read literally was WEAKER than intended. Voids
   the **protective claim** specifically; see Amendment 4 (R2) for the
   whole-run vs protective-claim table.
6. See Amendment 1 — chunk vectors must be valid.
7. See Amendment 3 — the page must be the benchmark's own (`page_source`).
8. See Amendment 4 (R4) — zero fallbacks, zero containment violations, and the
   positive control. Voids the **whole run**.

---

## 8. Declared limitations  *(requirements g and i)*

1. **The 512-token truncation defect is un-refit.** Chunk embeddings were
   computed from ~12% of each chunk. It does not touch this result — fact
   vectors are unaffected and were *proven* identical to the prepass's to
   8.9e-16 — but it is why `nmargin`/`H_z` are inert (§1), and it means the
   Stage-0 precondition layer is untested rather than validated.
2. **The 50-fact pool cap, and the recall trend it produces.** The gate sees the
   50 most query-similar facts of the page. Measured:

   | | sh_6k | sh_32k | direction |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | pair recall vs the whole page | 0.0885 | 0.0151 | falling fast with store size |
   | conflicted-question recall | 0.973 | 0.938 | falling |

   **`sh_64k` is 4,580 facts against `sh_32k`'s 2,310, so the effect is expected
   to be SMALLER than `sh_32k`'s +44 — and under Branch A smaller again, because
   retrieval itself is incomplete there (10 of 17 chunks).** No part of the
   write-up may present +44, or +62, as transferring to `sh_64k`. The
   pre-registered threshold is +10 for exactly this reason.
3. **New failure mode at `sh_64k`, absent from all calibration evidence:
   incomplete retrieval.** ~41% of the context is off the page, so the queried
   key's superseder may simply not be there. A detector cannot suppress a fact
   it never sees, and it cannot promote one either. This is unmeasured and is
   the single largest source of uncertainty in the transfer.
4. **Parse coverage.** `conflict_analysis.parse` covers 4,563/4,580 = **99.63%**
   of `sh_64k` facts. The 17 unparsed facts cannot pass the identity screen, so
   they can never join a group; in the harm audit an unparsed deletion is
   counted **as harmful**, which is the conservative direction.
5. **Whole-context vs retrieval-path.** All calibration evidence is
   whole-context. §0 and §10 exist because of this gap; under Branch A the
   confirmatory number is retrieval-path and the calibration bridge is what
   makes it interpretable.
6. **The `anti` control is inconsistent across subsets** *(requirement i)*: it
   measured **−4 on `sh_6k`** (harmful, as the oracle's `anti` was) and **+6 on
   `sh_32k`** (helpful, where the oracle's `anti` was −4). Two differences are
   known: the oracle arm additionally moved the most recent STALE fact to the
   END, an adversarial second edit this mirror does not make; and the detector
   stacks ~13 latest carriers at one edge of a 2,310-fact context rather than
   moving a single fact. At 32k length both edges appear privileged
   (`demote_late` +9 and `anti` +6 both help). **Therefore the placement
   direction is NOT established for the detector-driven version, `anti` is
   registered as a reported control only, and no part of the success criterion
   depends on it.** Suppression is untouched by this.
7. Single model (`Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507`), single arena, single run.

---

## 9. Execution discipline  *(requirement h)*

- **Analysis code is committed with this document and is not modified between
  registration and reporting:** `hnav/stage1/detector_gap.py` (arms, grading,
  McNemar, strata, token accounting, oracle comparison, gold-cut accounting),
  `hnav/core/read_policy.py`, `hnav/adapters/mab_adapter.py`. The campaign
  artifact records `git_head`; it must be at or after this file's commit.
- **Single shot.** One run, one operating point, one subset. No re-runs under a
  different operating point, no second look with a different threshold.
- **No optional stopping.** All 100 questions × 5 arms are executed before any
  accuracy figure is inspected. The script computes every statistic in one pass
  and writes one artifact.
- **`HNAV_MODE`** is `off` for the measurement harness (`require_not_live`);
  under Branch A the shipped seam is exercised through `page_edit` /
  `apply_read_decision` directly, which the tests pin as byte-identical to the
  armed live path.
- Whatever comes out is reported: table, gold-cuts observed vs predicted,
  void-condition status, and the limitations above restated.

---

## 10. Companion exploratory arm — retrieval path on the CALIBRATION split

**Explicitly NOT part of the confirmatory claim**, reported separately, and run
on `sh_6k`/`sh_32k` only.

The deployed system reads a rank-ordered page of retrieved chunks, not one
whole-context block. On the calibration split retrieval is complete (2 and 9
chunks ≤ 10), so switching harnesses there changes **only the block structure
and order** — which isolates that variable from retrieval incompleteness, the
variable that only appears at `sh_64k`. That gives the three-point decomposition
the claim needs:

| setting | retrieval | block structure | what it isolates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| whole-context, calibration | complete | one block, context order | the mechanism (**done**: 0.984 / 0.957 of oracle) |
| retrieval-path, calibration | complete | top-10 blocks, rank order | **block structure** |
| retrieval-path, `sh_64k` | **incomplete** | top-10 blocks, rank order | **+ retrieval incompleteness** |

Under Branch A this is a prerequisite for interpreting the confirmatory run, not
an optional extra. It is registered here so that its result — whatever it is —
is on the record before the confirmatory run, and so that a weak result here
cannot be quietly dropped.

If time or GPU forces a choice, the confirmatory run comes first.

---

## Amendment 1 — a second Branch A prerequisite  ·  2026-08-15, post-registration

**This amendment only ADDS a constraint and a void condition. It relaxes
nothing, changes no criterion, no threshold and no prediction.** It is recorded
separately, with its own timestamp, because a registered document must not be
silently edited.

**Measured after registration.** Every `sh_64k` vector the harness would need is
already in the shared cache — 4,580/4,580 facts and 17/17 chunks — but all of
them sit under the pre-T12 namespace `Qwen_Qwen3-Embedding-4B|float32`, i.e.
they were embedded with the **512-token truncation defect** in force. Nothing is
cached under `|L512` or `|L8192`.

For facts this is harmless and already argued (§8.1): a fact is one short
sentence, far under 512 tokens, and the vectors were *proven* identical to the
prepass's to 8.9e-16.

For CHUNKS it is not harmless **at `sh_64k` specifically**, and the reason is new:

- on the calibration split, chunk vectors only decide the *order* of a page that
  contains every chunk anyway (2 and 9 ≤ `top_k` 10), so a defective ranking
  changes nothing about *what the model sees* — which is why every committed
  calibration result stands unaffected;
- at `sh_64k`, chunk vectors decide **which 10 of 17 chunks are on the page at
  all**. A ranking computed from ~12% of each chunk would select the page, and
  the confirmatory number would then be about a page the benchmark's own
  retriever would not have produced.

**Prerequisite added for Branch A.** Before any `sh_64k` confirmatory run, the
17 `sh_64k` chunks must be re-embedded at the corrected `max_length` (8192, the
current `DEFAULT_MAX_LENGTH`) and the prepass ranking recomputed from those
vectors. The re-embedding is trivial compute (17 texts) but currently blocked:
the fp32 embedder needs ~17 GB and both GPUs are held by the two chat servers.
Freeing the :8003 card and restoring it byte-identically is acceptable; the
user's :8000 is not ours to touch.

**Void condition 6 (added).** The `sh_64k` confirmatory run is void if its
chunk-level ranking was computed from 512-truncated chunk vectors. The run
artifact must record the embedding-cache namespace actually used, and it must be
the `L8192` one for chunks.

**Note for Branch B.** Branch B does not need this — a whole-context prompt has
no retrieval step — but Branch B remains blocked by §0's window arithmetic, so
this does not revive it.

---

## Amendment 2 — Branch A adopted, and a third harm class  ·  2026-08-15, post-registration

**User decision, 2026-08-15.** Recorded before any `sh_64k` inference of any kind.

### 2.1 Branch A is the design

The confirmatory run uses the **retrieval-path harness**: the benchmark's own
top-`k` chunks, `Memory i:` blocks in similarity-rank order, edited through the
shipped `page_edit` / `apply_read_decision` seam. Reasons of record:

- whole-context is physically impossible at `sh_64k` (75,886 > 65,536, §0);
- it is not the deployed setting there either (17 chunks, 10 retrieved);
- the retrieval page fits the **frozen** substrate untouched — and the frozen
  server's own header says its window was sized for exactly this
  ("sh_64k RAG prompts are ~53k tokens", `hnav/deploy/serve_stage1_chat.sh`), so
  Branch A is what that substrate was built for;
- on the calibration split the mechanism performed **equal or better** in this
  harness (conflicted 68/74 vs 66/74 on `sh_6k`, 52/65 vs 51/65 on `sh_32k`),
  with the `anti` control behaving consistently for the first time.

Branch B is **dropped, not deferred**. §1's claim scoping now reads against the
retrieval harness; every other criterion, threshold and prediction is unchanged.

The companion arm of §10 has been **executed** (`sh_6k` and `sh_32k`, 1,000
calls, committed as `detector_gap_retrieval_sh{6k,32k}.json`), so the bridge it
was registered to provide exists before the confirmatory run rather than after.

### 2.2 `refusal_after_edit` — a third harm class, added as a REPORTED class

**Discovered 2026-08-15 in the calibration retrieval arm, BEFORE any `sh_64k`
inference**, at commit `84e7d2c` (2026-08-15T21:00:42+03:00, "T13: retrieval bridge complete"). The case is `sh_32k` retrieval, question 14, unique stratum: native
answered `"Beirut"`; the suppressed arm answered *"The provided knowledge pool
does not contain any fact about"*. The gold fact was **still on the page** —
nothing it needed had been deleted — and the model declined anyway.

The registered §5b rule is binary (`malformed_generation` if the gold value is
present AND `SequenceMatcher ≥ 0.8`; `information_loss` otherwise), so it
classifies this as `information_loss`, and one of those voids the protective
claim. **That verdict stands.** Three named classes replace the binary split,
all counted and all reported separately:

| class | test, applied in this order | counts as harm? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gold_cut` | the gold-valued fact of the queried key was deleted from the page | **yes** |
| `malformed_generation` | gold present on the page AND `SequenceMatcher(native, arm) ≥ 0.8` | **yes** |
| `refusal_after_edit` | gold present, arm output matches the evaluator's empty/refusal shape (`question_strata.error_class` → `empty`, or a refusal string containing "does not contain" / "no fact" / "not contain any") | **yes** |
| `information_loss` | anything else | **yes** |

**The rule does not get weaker.** Every class counts as harm; every class enters
`b` in the McNemar cells exactly as before; and the §5b voiding condition is
restated unchanged in its effect: **any unique-stratum harm that is not
`malformed_generation` voids the protective claim.** `refusal_after_edit` is
therefore voiding, precisely as `information_loss` was. The user explicitly
rejected exempting refusals, on the grounds that loosening a harm rule
immediately after seeing a case that would have failed it is what a hostile
reviewer attacks first. This amendment **makes the criterion more diagnosable,
not more permissive**: the same runs pass and fail as before, and the report can
now say *which* failure occurred instead of collapsing three mechanisms into one
label.

### 2.3 A registered prediction for the new class — and its honest width

Calibration evidence for `detector_suppress` in the retrieval harness:

| subset | conflicted | unique | total harms (`b`) | `gold_cut` | `refusal_after_edit` | `malformed_generation` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sh_6k` retrieval | 74 | 26 | **0** | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `sh_32k` retrieval | 65 | 35 | **2** | 1 | 1 | 0 |

**Registered prediction for `sh_64k`: `gold_cut` = 2** (unchanged from §6:
exposure 2/66 × conflicted recall 0.957 = 1.91; only 0, 1 or 2 are
arithmetically possible).

**For `refusal_after_edit` I decline to register a point prediction, and say so
rather than invent one.** The entire evidence base is *one* event in 200
calibration questions. A rate estimated from a single occurrence has a 95%
interval that spans roughly 0.03%–2.8% per question — on 100 questions that is
"between 0 and 3", which is not a prediction, it is the absence of one. What is
registered instead, and is falsifiable:

- **`refusal_after_edit` will be counted and reported** for every arm, whether
  or not any occur;
- **0 is the modal expectation** (it did not occur at all on `sh_6k` retrieval,
  74 conflicted + 26 unique questions);
- **≥ 4 on `sh_64k` would be a qualitative departure** from calibration — more
  than double the total harm rate observed there — and is registered here as the
  threshold at which the class must be treated as a real scaling effect of the
  mechanism rather than noise, and reported as such.

## Amendment 3 — the page must be the benchmark's own  ·  2026-08-15, post-registration

**Adds a constraint and a void condition; relaxes nothing.** Recorded after
Amendment 1's prerequisite was executed and turned out not to be sufficient.

### 3.1 What was measured

Amendment 1 required re-embedding the `sh_64k` chunks at the corrected length.
Doing it (`hnav/deploy/refit_chunk_embeddings.py`,
`stage0_results/stage1/chunk_embedding_refit.json`) surfaced two things:

**(a) The benchmark's encoder is `bfloat16`, not `float32`.**
`AutoModel.from_pretrained(model, device_map="auto")` with no dtype resolves to
the checkpoint's `torch_dtype`. It also calls `tokenizer(text, truncation=True)`
with **no `max_length`**, so it truncates at `model_max_length` = **131,072** —
i.e. not at all, for chunks whose longest is 5,243 tokens. H-Nav pinned fp32 and
was truncating at 512.

**(b) Matching the benchmark on both axes is still not enough.** Corrected
bf16/8192 chunk vectors reach min cosine **0.99997** of the benchmark's own —
and the `sh_64k` top-10 page still agrees on only:

| chunk vectors | page set agreement vs the benchmark | mean Jaccard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H-Nav bf16 @8192 (corrected) | **26/100** | 0.846 |
| H-Nav fp32 @512 (the stale cache) | **3/100** | 0.676 |

Seventeen chunks with tightly clustered query similarities reshuffle at the
top-10/11 boundary under a 3e-5 perturbation. So no encoder configuration
reproduces the page; the premise "re-embed correctly and the page is right" is
false.

### 3.2 The resolution

**The page is READ from the benchmark's own vectors, not recomputed from ours** —
the M0 precedent that earned the 1.0000 replica-fidelity claim: reconstruct
through the benchmark's own code path rather than approximate it. The refit
artifact records the benchmark's top-10 page for all 100 questions of each
subset, so this costs no further computation.

`detector_gap.py --harness retrieval` now **requires** an explicit
`--page-source`; there is no default, because the two sources differ on 74% of
`sh_64k` questions and a silent choice would decide the confirmatory result.
The confirmatory run uses `--page-source benchmark`.

### 3.3 Void condition 7 (added)

The `sh_64k` confirmatory run is **void** if its page was not taken from the
benchmark's own chunk vectors. The artifact records `page_source`, and it must
read `"benchmark"`.

Void condition 6 (Amendment 1) is **superseded in mechanism but not in spirit**:
what matters is no longer "were our chunk vectors re-embedded at 8192" but "was
the page the benchmark's own". Condition 7 replaces it; condition 6 is retained
in the record because it is how condition 7 was found.

### 3.4 What this does NOT disturb

- **Fact vectors are invariant to the length change** — max cosine deviation
  7.9e-12 / 1.7e-11 / 1.7e-11 across the three subsets. Facts are one short
  sentence, far under either budget. So the frozen operating point, the 1.000
  pair precision and every committed detection number carry over untouched, and
  **no re-fit of the gate is required**.
- **Every committed calibration result stands.** On `sh_6k` and `sh_32k`,
  retrieval is complete (2 and 9 chunks ≤ `top_k` 10), so the benchmark's page
  is a permutation of *all* chunks and page MEMBERSHIP cannot differ under any
  encoder. Only block order does. The exposure is specific to `sh_64k` — which
  is precisely where the one shot would have been spent.
- The 512-truncation defect remains un-refit for `nmargin`/`H_z`, which stay
  inert (§1); nothing here changes that.

## Amendment 4 — supervisor pre-flight required changes  ·  2026-08-15, post-registration

Four text corrections and one new void condition, required by the supervisor
pre-flight before firing. **No threshold, prediction or success criterion is
changed.** R1 and R4 make the document STRICTER; R2 and R3 remove ambiguity that
would otherwise have been resolved after seeing data, which is the thing a
pre-registration exists to prevent.

### R1 — void condition 5 restated (it had gone stale, and stale meant WEAKER)

§7 condition 5 reads "Any unique-stratum `information_loss` under the §5b
classifier". Amendment 2 replaced that binary split with four classes, so read
literally the old wording **no longer catches `refusal_after_edit`** — the exact
case that motivated the amendment. The frozen analysis code already implements
the strong rule (`class != "malformed_generation"`), so this is the prose
catching up to the code, not a change of rule.

> **Void condition 5 (restated).** Any **unique-stratum harm classified other
> than `malformed_generation`** — i.e. any of `gold_cut`, `refusal_after_edit`
> or `information_loss` on the protected stratum. This voids the **protective
> claim** (see R2).

The voiding set is unchanged from the original registration: everything except
`malformed_generation`. It is if anything stricter, because `gold_cut` is now
tested *first* and so catches a unique-stratum gold deletion that the old binary
rule could have waved through as `malformed_generation` on a string-similarity
coincidence.

### R2 — whole-run void vs protective-claim void, decided in advance

§7's preamble ("the run is void … does not count as the single shot") and §5b
("voids the protective claim") describe **two different outcomes**, and the
document did not say which applies to which condition. Settled here, before the
run, because it is likely to be load-bearing: in the harness now chosen for the
shot, the protective claim **already voids on calibration** (`sh_32k` retrieval
q14) and one refusal on `sh_64k` does it again.

| condition | what it voids |
| --- | --- |
| 1, 6, 7, 8 (wiring, page source, fallbacks) | **the whole run.** The intervention did not happen as specified; nothing is measured; the shot is NOT spent. |
| 2, 3 (native band, A/A floor) | **the whole run.** The substrate is not the one calibrated on; every paired statistic is unreadable. |
| 4 (`n_suppressed_harmful > 0`) | **the whole run.** The detector deleted a current value; the frozen operating point is not the one audited. |
| **5 (protected-stratum harm)** | **the protective claim ONLY.** The run stands, the accuracy result stands, and the shot IS spent. |

**The publishable conclusion when the accuracy criterion passes and the
protective claim voids** — stated now so it cannot be composed after seeing the
number:

> Fact-level suppression of detector-verified stale memory raises accuracy on
> the conflicted stratum by *N* net discordant pairs (exact *p*), **at a
> measured cost on the non-conflicted stratum of *k* question(s), mechanism
> *class*.** The protective condition registered for this campaign is therefore
> **not met**, and the mechanism is reported as *effective but not yet safe*:
> it may not be recommended for deployment on traffic containing
> non-conflicted queries until the harm mechanism is understood and eliminated.

That is a real, reportable, honest result — not a null and not a success. It is
written down now precisely because it is the outcome the calibration evidence
makes most likely.

**Closing the unclassified 1–3 band** left open by Amendment 2's declined point
prediction for `refusal_after_edit`:

- **0** — the modal expectation (0 occurred on `sh_6k` retrieval, 100 questions).
- **1–3** — voids the protective claim per condition 5, and is reported as an
  **unresolved harm mechanism warranting a replicate**. The accuracy claim
  stands; the safety claim does not.
- **≥ 4** — additionally a **scaling effect**: more than double the total harm
  rate seen anywhere on calibration, and must be reported as a property of the
  mechanism at larger stores rather than as noise.

The ≥4 threshold and the "0 is modal" commitment from Amendment 2 are unchanged.

### R3 — the page ORDER provenance changes, and what that does and does not predict

Amendment 3 protects page **membership** on the calibration split — with 2 and 9
chunks against `top_k` 10, the benchmark's page is a permutation of all chunks,
so membership cannot differ under any encoder (measured: `set_agreement` 1.0,
`mean_jaccard` 1.0 for both encoders on both subsets). **Order is not
protected**, and differs substantially:

| subset | `order_agreement` vs the benchmark's page |
| --- | --- |
| `sh_6k` | 0.99 (bf16) / 0.84 (legacy) |
| `sh_32k` | **0.19** (bf16) / **0.00** (legacy) |

The committed calibration retrieval runs (`84e7d2c`, 2026-08-15T21:00:42+03:00)
**predate** the `--page-source` flag (`0c8763d`, 21:27), so they used H-Nav's
block order. The `sh_64k` run will use the benchmark's. Consequences, declared:

- **`SUPPRESS` deletes by fact identity, not by position**, so its effect should
  transfer across a reordering of the same blocks. Its *direction* is predicted;
  its *magnitude* is not.
- **Absolute `native` accuracy may shift** with block order. Void condition 2's
  band is wide enough to absorb that and is unchanged.
- **`DEMOTE_LATE` manipulates exactly this variable**, so its calibration
  numbers transfer least of all. It is already excluded from the success
  criterion (§3); this is a second, independent reason to read it as
  exploratory.
- Therefore: **the calibration "equal or better" result predicts DIRECTION, not
  magnitude.** No part of the write-up may present the calibration nets (+66,
  +38) as a forecast of the `sh_64k` net. §4's threshold is +10 and §8.2 already
  says the effect is expected to be smaller; R3 adds order provenance as a third
  reason.

### R4 — void condition 8 (new)

> **Void condition 8.** `n_rerank_fallbacks > 0`, any `page_edit_error`
> recorded, or `n_containment_violations > 0`, on any question. **Voids the
> whole run.**
>
> This is the false-null signature and it is the reason the guard package
> exists: if the policy names a fact the page does not carry, `page_edit`
> raises, the live seam fails open to the native page, and the artifact records
> a run in which the intervention never happened — which from the outside is
> indistinguishable from the intervention having had no effect. On a one-shot
> confirmatory subset that is the worst available failure. A non-zero counter is
> therefore reported as VOID and never as a null result.
>
> The positive control is part of the same condition: `n_fact_edits_applied`
> must equal the number of questions on which the policy fired (expected 100 —
> firing is unconditional at the frozen operating point) and
> `n_facts_suppressed` must be > 0. "Edits applied but nothing suppressed" is
> the silent-gutting signature and voids the run identically.

Conditions 1–4, 6 and 7 are unchanged, as are the native band derivation, the
A/A floor condition, `page_source` having no default, §1's scope wording, the
no-optional-stopping language and §8's limitations.
